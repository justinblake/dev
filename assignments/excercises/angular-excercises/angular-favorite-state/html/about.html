        <h3>About Oregon</h3>
        <p>Oregon (Listeni/ˈɔːrᵻɡən/ awr-ə-gən)[7] is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.
            Oregon is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by Washington, on the south by California,
            on the east by Idaho, and on the southeast by Nevada. The Columbia River delineates much of Oregon's
            northern boundary, and the Snake River delineates much of the eastern boundary. The parallel 42° north
            delineates the southern boundary with California and Nevada. It is one of only three states of the
            contiguous United States to have a coastline on the Pacific Ocean, and the proximity to the ocean heavily
            influences the state's mild winter climate, despite the latitude.

            Oregon was inhabited by many indigenous tribes before Western traders, explorers, and settlers arrived. An
            autonomous government was formed in the Oregon Country in 1843, the Oregon Territory was created in 1848,
            and Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. Today, at 98,000 square miles (255,000 km²), Oregon
            is the ninth largest and, with a population of 4 million, 27th most populous U.S. state. The capital of
            Oregon is Salem, the second most populous of its cities, with 164,549 residents (2015 estimate). Portland is
            Oregon's most populous city, with 632,309 residents (2015 estimate), and ranks as the 26th most populous
            city in the United States. Portland's metro population of 2,389,228 (2015 estimate) ranks the 23rd largest
            metro in the nation. The Willamette Valley in western Oregon is the state's most densely populated area,
            home to eight of the ten most populous cities.
